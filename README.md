# Substack Writing Assistant

A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) skill that helps writers craft Substack articles. It provides structure, synthesis, and feedback—without writing the article for you.

## Philosophy

This skill empowers writers rather than replacing them. It will:
- Synthesize your research into usable themes
- Generate outlines and structure suggestions
- Propose headlines and CTAs
- Provide editorial feedback on your drafts

It will **never** write your article for you.

## Installation

1. Create a `.claude/skills/` directory in your project
2. Copy `SKILL.md` into that directory
3. The skill will be available as `/substack` in Claude Code

```
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        └── substack/
            └── SKILL.md
```

## Usage

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/substack new <name>` | Create a new article directory structure |
| `/substack research` | Synthesize all materials in `research/` folder |
| `/substack outline` | Generate a detailed outline from research |
| `/substack structure` | Get article format recommendations |
| `/substack headlines` | Generate title and subtitle options |
| `/substack edit` | Get editorial feedback on your draft |
| `/substack refine` | Compile your checkbox selections into a unified plan |

### Workflow

The skill uses a checkbox-driven workflow designed for Obsidian. Mark your selections with `[x]` in each generated file, then run `/substack refine` to compile everything.

```
1. /substack new "my-article"
2. Add notes, sources, and quotes to research/
3. /substack research
4. [In Obsidian: mark preferred angles with [x]]
5. /substack structure (optional)
6. [In Obsidian: mark preferred structure with [x]]
7. /substack outline
8. [In Obsidian: mark hook, key points, CTA with [x]]
9. /substack refine                              ← compiles your selections
10. Write your draft in draft.md
11. /substack headlines
12. [In Obsidian: mark preferred headline with [x]]
13. /substack edit
14. [In Obsidian: mark feedback items [x] as you address them]
15. /substack refine                             ← tracks revision progress
16. Finalize and publish
```

### Directory Structure

Each article gets its own directory. The skill generates dedicated output files for each mode:

```
my-article/
├── research/              # Your source material (skill reads from here)
│   ├── notes.md
│   ├── sources.md
│   └── quotes.md
├── research-synthesis.md  # Generated by /substack research
├── structure.md           # Generated by /substack structure
├── outline.md             # Generated by /substack outline
├── headlines.md           # Generated by /substack headlines
├── draft.md               # Your writing
├── feedback.md            # Generated by /substack edit
└── refined.md             # Generated by /substack refine
```

## Features

### Research Synthesis
Reads all markdown files in your `research/` directory and extracts:
- Core themes and arguments
- Key points with source references
- Usable quotes and statistics
- Gaps and questions to address
- Potential angles for the article (with checkboxes to select)

### Outline Generation
Creates a dual-format outline with:
- Suggested thesis/angle
- Multiple hook options (checkboxes)
- Section-by-section breakdown with purpose, bullet points, and narrative flow
- Evidence mapping from your research
- CTA options for the closing (checkboxes)

### Structure Recommendations
Suggests the best article format for your content:
- Argument/Analysis
- Narrative
- Tutorial/How-to
- Listicle
- Interview/Profile
- Personal Essay

### Headline Options
Generates 5-10 title options across styles:
- Direct/Clear
- Curiosity/Hook
- Bold Claim

Each paired with a subtitle (email preview text) and engagement notes.

### Editorial Feedback
Provides developmental feedback without rewriting:
- Strengths to keep developing
- Structure and flow observations
- Clarity questions (not answers)
- Energy drop identification
- Generic phrasing alerts
- Voice pattern notes

### Refine & Compile
Reads all generated files, parses your checkbox selections, and produces:
- Consolidated article plan with your chosen elements
- Feedback tracking (addressed vs. pending items)
- Clear next steps based on your progress

## Obsidian Integration

This skill is designed to work seamlessly with Obsidian:

**Checkbox Syntax:**
- `- [ ]` = unchecked (option available)
- `- [x]` = checked (your selection)

**Workflow:**
1. Run a skill mode (e.g., `/substack outline`)
2. Open the generated file in Obsidian
3. Click checkboxes to mark your selections
4. Run `/substack refine` to compile your choices

The skill respects your offline edits—any notes or additions you make to generated files are preserved.
