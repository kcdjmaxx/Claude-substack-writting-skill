### Guidelines

**Keep the philosophy intact:**
- The skill should empower writers, not replace them
- Never add features that write content for the user
- Feedback should ask questions, not provide answers

**Skill design principles:**
- Each mode should have a clear, single purpose
- Output formats should be consistent and scannable
- Research is the boundary—only synthesize what the user provides

**Code style:**
- Use clear markdown formatting
- Keep instructions concise but complete
- Include example output formats
